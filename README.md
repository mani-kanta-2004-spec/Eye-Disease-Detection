# Eye-Disease-Detection
Eye Disease Detection app
• Developed an Eye Disease Detection model using U-Net for retinal segmentation, Autoencoder for Out-Of
Distribution (OOD) detection and feature extraction, and Dense Neural Networks for classification. 
• Used the Unified Retina Dataset (CHASE_DB1, DRIVE, e_optha_EX, e_optha_MA, IDRiD).
